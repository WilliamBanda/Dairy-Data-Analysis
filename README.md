# Dairy Data Analysis

## Overview
This repository contains the data and analysis scripts for a study comparing static and interactive dashboards in the context of dairy data visualization. The project aims to evaluate user perceptions and preferences between these two dashboard types.

## Contents
- `Dashboard Survey.xlsx`: Raw survey data collected from participants
- `Likert data Analysis.R`: R script for analyzing Likert scale responses
- `MRP.Rproj`: R project file for easy setup in RStudio

## Data Description
The survey data includes responses from 60 participants, evaluating various aspects of both static and interactive dashboards. Key variables include:

- Dashboard type (static/interactive)
- Ease of understanding
- Control over data
- Visualization sufficiency
- Yearly comparison capabilities
- Feature adequacy
- User-friendliness
- Option overload
- Ease of use
- Overall satisfaction
- Demographic information (age, education, experience)

## Analysis
The R script (`Likert data Analysis.R`) performs several analyses:

1. Data loading and preprocessing
2. Descriptive statistics
3. Visualization of Likert scale responses
4. Age distribution analysis
5. Statistical tests (t-tests) to compare perceptions between dashboard types

## Requirements
To run the analysis, you'll need:
- R (version 4.3 or later recommended)
- RStudio (optional, but recommended)
- Required R packages: tidyverse, readxl, ggplot2, shiny, writexl, plotly, reshape2, likert

## Usage
1. Clone this repository
2. Open the `MRP.Rproj` file in RStudio
3. Run the `Likert data Analysis.R` script to reproduce the analysis

## Results
The analysis provides insights into user preferences between static and interactive dashboards, highlighting areas where each type excels and potential improvements for both.
